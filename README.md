# AzurePrOps

A minimal Avalonia UI tool for interacting with Azure DevOps pull requests.

Upon launch, the application now prompts for your organization, project, repository, reviewer id and personal access token (PAT). These values are stored only for the current session and remove the need to edit the source code when connecting to different projects.

The settings window also lets you choose which external editor to open files with. Available options are detected based on the editors found on your system.
