# Dark Mode Implementation - Complete

## Overview
A full dark mode theme has been successfully implemented for the AzurePrOps application. The implementation includes comprehensive theme switching functionality that allows users to toggle between System, Light, and Dark themes via the Settings page.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core Theme Infrastructure ✅
- **ThemeManager Service** (`Services/ThemeManager.cs`)
  - Handles dynamic theme switching between Light, Dark, and System themes
  - Automatically detects Windows system theme preference
  - Subscribes to UIPreferences changes for real-time theme updates
  - Manages theme resource loading and cleanup

### 2. Dark Theme Resources ✅
- **DarkTheme.xaml** (`Styles/DarkTheme.xaml`)
  - Comprehensive GitHub Dark-inspired color palette
  - Dark backgrounds: `#0D1117` (primary), `#161B22` (surface)
  - Light text: `#F0F6FC` (primary), `#7D8590` (secondary)
  - Appropriate contrast ratios for accessibility
  - All color resources match existing light theme structure

### 3. Application Integration ✅
- **App.axaml** - Removed hardcoded light theme constraint
- **App.axaml.cs** - Integrated ThemeManager initialization
- **Settings Integration** - Theme toggle is now fully functional

### 4. Theme Switching Logic ✅
- **System Theme** (Index 0): Follows Windows system preference
- **Light Theme** (Index 1): Uses original light color scheme
- **Dark Theme** (Index 2): Uses new dark color palette
- **Persistence**: Theme preference is saved and restored across app restarts
- **Real-time Updates**: Theme changes apply immediately without restart

## How to Test

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Launch the Application**
   - App will start with your last saved theme preference
   - Default is System theme (follows Windows preference)

2. **Access Settings**
   - If you have connection settings configured, click the Settings button
   - Navigate to the "Interface" section

3. **Test Theme Switching**
   - Use the "Theme" dropdown with options: System, Light, Dark
   - Changes should apply immediately upon selection
   - Save settings to persist the theme choice

4. **Verify Components**
   - ✅ Main window background and text
   - ✅ Settings window styling
   - ✅ Buttons and interactive controls
   - ✅ Input fields and dropdowns
   - ✅ Cards and containers
   - ✅ Borders and separators

5. **Test Persistence**
   - Close and restart the application
   - Verify theme preference is maintained

## Visual Changes in Dark Mode

### Backgrounds
- Main background: `#0D1117` (very dark gray)
- Surface elements: `#161B22` (dark gray)
- Card backgrounds: `#21262D` (medium dark gray)

### Text
- Primary text: `#F0F6FC` (off-white)
- Secondary text: `#7D8590` (gray)
- High contrast for readability

### Interactive Elements
- Hover states: `#21262D` (subtle highlight)
- Selected states: `#1C2128` (blue-tinted dark)
- Focus indicators: `#1F6FEB` (blue - consistent across themes)

### Semantic Colors
- Success: `#3FB950` (green)
- Error/Danger: `#F85149` (red)
- Warning: `#D29922` (yellow)

## Known Limitations

### Components with Hardcoded Colors (Minor Issues):
- **TemporaryHighlightTransformer**: Still uses light theme colors for line highlighting
- **SearchHighlightTransformer**: May need dark theme adaptation
- These components will work but may have reduced contrast in dark mode

### Future Improvements:
1. Update hardcoded color components to use dynamic theme resources
2. Add theme-specific icons if needed
3. Fine-tune color contrasts based on user feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme Manager Architecture:
```csharp
// Initialization
ThemeManager.Initialize(); // Called in App.axaml.cs

// Theme switching
UIPreferences.SelectedThemeIndex = 2; // Triggers theme change

// Resource management
Application.Current.RequestedThemeVariant = ThemeVariant.Dark;
```

### File Structure:
```

├── Services/
│   └── ThemeManager.cs          # Theme switching logic
├── Styles/
│   ├── Styles.xaml             # Original light theme

## Conclusion

The dark mode implementation is **complete and functional**. Users can now:
- ✅ Toggle between Light, Dark, and System themes
- ✅ Enjoy a visually appealing dark interface
- ✅ Have their theme preference persist across sessions
- ✅ Experience consistent styling across all major UI components

The implementation follows modern theming best practices and provides a professional dark mode experience that matches contemporary application standards.
