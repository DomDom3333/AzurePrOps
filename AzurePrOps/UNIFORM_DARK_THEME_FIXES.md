# Uniform Dark Theme Application - Fixes Applied

## Issue Summary
The dark theme was not applying uniformly across the application due to two main problems:
1. **Hardcoded overlay colors** using `#80000000` that didn't adapt to theme changes
2. **StaticResource references** that were resolved at compile-time and didn't update when themes switched

## Root Cause Analysis
- **StaticResource vs DynamicResource**: StaticResource bindings are resolved once at compile time, while DynamicResource bindings are resolved at runtime and can change when theme resources are updated
- **Hardcoded colors**: Direct color values like `#80000000` bypass the theme system entirely
- **Missing overlay resources**: No theme-aware overlay background resources were defined

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Overlay Background Resources ✅

**Light Theme (Styles.xaml)**:
```xml
<!-- Overlay backgrounds for modals and loading screens -->
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="OverlayBackgroundBrush" Color="#80000000" />
```

**Dark Theme (DarkTheme.xaml)**:
```xml
<!-- Overlay backgrounds for modals and loading screens - dark theme -->
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="OverlayBackgroundBrush" Color="#80161B22" />
```

### 2. Fixed Hardcoded Overlay Colors ✅

**MainWindow.axaml** - Loading overlay:
```xml
<!-- Before -->
<Border Background="#80000000" ...>

<!-- After -->
<Border Background="{DynamicResource OverlayBackgroundBrush}" ...>
```

**PullRequestDetailsWindow.axaml** - Loading overlay:
```xml
<!-- Before -->
<Border Background="#80000000" ...>

<!-- After -->
<Border Background="{DynamicResource OverlayBackgroundBrush}" ...>
```

### 3. Updated Critical StaticResource References ✅

**MainWindow.axaml** - Updated key components:
- Window background: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`
- Header section: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`
- Progress bar: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`

**PullRequestDetailsWindow.axaml** - Updated key components:
- Main grid background: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`
- Header section: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`
- Loading dialog: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`

**Styles.xaml** - Updated base styles:
- Window selector: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`
- TextBlock selector: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`
- Button styles: `StaticResource → DynamicResource`

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Launch the Application**
   ```
   X:\GitKraken\Personal\AzurePrOps\AzurePrOps\AzurePrOps\bin\Debug\net9.0\AzurePrOps.exe
   ```

2. **Test Theme Switching**
   - Go to Settings → Interface → Theme
   - Switch between "Light", "Dark", and "System" themes
   - Changes should apply immediately to all visible components

3. **Verify Uniform Application**
   Check that the following components adapt properly to dark theme:
   
   ✅ **Main Window Components**:
   - Background color changes from light gray to dark gray
   - Header section adapts to theme
   - Pull request cards use theme colors
   - Text remains readable in both themes
   
   ✅ **Loading Overlays**:
   - Loading overlay when opening PR details
   - Progress bars use theme-appropriate colors
   - Overlay is visible in both light and dark themes
   
   ✅ **Pull Request Details Window**:
   - Main background adapts to theme
   - Header section uses theme colors
   - Loading dialog uses theme colors
   - File diff sections (if visible) adapt properly
   
   ✅ **Settings Window**:
   - Background and surface colors adapt
   - Form controls use theme colors
   - Error messages use theme-appropriate colors

### Expected Behavior:

**Light Theme**:
- Light backgrounds (#F6F8FA, #FFFFFF)
- Dark text (#24292F)
- Semi-transparent black overlay (#80000000)

**Dark Theme**:
- Dark backgrounds (#0D1117, #161B22)
- Light text (#F0F6FC)
- Semi-transparent dark overlay (#80161B22)

**System Theme**:
- Follows Windows system preference
- Automatically switches between light/dark based on system setting

## Remaining Known Issues

### Components Still Using StaticResource (Lower Priority):
- Some text color references in pull request list items
- Expander controls in file diff sections
- Minor interactive state colors

These components will work but may not have perfect theme adaptation. They can be addressed in future updates if needed.

### Components with Hardcoded Colors (Minor):
- `TemporaryHighlightTransformer.cs`: Line highlighting still uses hardcoded light colors
- `SearchHighlightTransformer.cs`: May need dark theme adaptation
- Some button hover states in Styles.xaml use hardcoded colors

## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme Resource Priority:
1. **DynamicResource** - Updates at runtime ✅ (Fixed)
2. **StaticResource** - Resolved at compile time ❌ (Causes issues)
3. **Hardcoded colors** - Never changes ❌ (Causes issues)

### Files Modified:
- `Styles/Styles.xaml` - Added overlay resource, updated key references
- `Styles/DarkTheme.xaml` - Added dark overlay resource
- `Views/MainWindow.axaml` - Fixed overlay and key references
- `Views/PullRequestDetailsWindow.axaml` - Fixed overlay and key references

## Success Criteria ✅

The following issues should now be resolved:
- ✅ Dark theme applies to main backgrounds
- ✅ Loading overlays are visible in both themes
- ✅ Header sections adapt properly
- ✅ Progress bars use theme colors
- ✅ Theme switching works immediately without restart
- ✅ No compilation errors introduced

## Conclusion

The major uniform dark theme application issues have been resolved. The application should now provide a consistent visual experience when switching between light and dark themes, with all major UI components properly adapting to the selected theme.
